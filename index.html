    Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website – they're all made with code. Here's a simple example of code, written in the Python language: print 'Hello, world!'

<h2 class="One">Benefits of Learning coding</h2>
<p id="para">
    Learning coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. These things include hand-crafting your own websites, becoming a career coder or even starting a technology business. Most importantly, you’ll be able to understand the technology shaping your world.

You’ve undoubtedly heard or read somewhere that everyone needs to learn coding, right? Well, people say that for a reason! Whether you’re looking for a career in the industry, starting a new hobby or just wanting to understand technology, you can benefit from learning coding.

Here are some of the things that learning coding can empower you to do.

<h2 class="Two">Make your own website</h2>
<p id="graph">
    It’s incredible to think how much the world has changed since 1991, when the World Wide Web first started. The web has taken over our lives and it’s showing no sign of stopping.

    Who knows where the web will take us in the future? Perhaps in another 10 years every person will have their own website. If one thing’s certain, it’s that a website is a very valuable thing to have these days.
    
    If you own a business, a web presence is a must. If you don’t, you still might want a personal blog or portfolio site to sell your skills to prospective employers. Of course, your ability to create and maintain a website is severely limited unless you learn HTML and CSS code, the code that all websites run on.
